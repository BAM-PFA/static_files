## Lynne Sachs archival donations

Digital donation was already really well organized! I ran Brunnhilde against the donation harddrive, and used the option to keep the Siegfried csv output. I used `pandas` to convert the csv to json, and used [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) to display the json using pagination and a simple filter option.
